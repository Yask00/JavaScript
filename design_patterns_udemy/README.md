    * `Liskov substitution principle` - if some method/function can take some base type it should also equally be able to take a derived type
    * `Interface segregaton` - class behaves as interface definition, no construction. Segragate into multiple interfaces - Machine -> Printer, Scanner, Photocopier
    * `Dependency Inversion principle` - no connection with dependency injection. Defines relationships that should have btw low and high level modules. High lever Research should not depend on low level like Relationships
