You are given two classes, Bird and Lizard, that both take the creature's age and allow the creature to fly/crawl (or not) depending on its age.

Please create a decorator called Dragon that acts as both a bird and a lizard, i.e., it has an age value and can both fly() and crawl(), reusing the original classes' functionality.
