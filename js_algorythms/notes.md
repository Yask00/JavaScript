An algorithm is a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation. Algorithms act as an exact list of instructions that conduct specified actions step by step in either hardware- or software-based routines.

Finding a library book is another example of using an algorithm in everyday life. There are multiple processes for successfully finding a library book, whether it’s by utilizing the library’s computer catalog system, identifying genre labels on shelves and finding the book by subject or author, etc. Regardless of the process used, if it can be defined and replicated by others then it is an algorithm.

# 1. Sorting Algorithm

Sorting is the process of arranging items in a list in a specific order. The most common types of sorting algorithms include

# 2. Searching Algorithm

Searching is the process of finding an element in a data set. Common types of searching algorithms include:

# 3. Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique that solves an optimization problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems and taking advantage of the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem is dependent on the optimal solution to its sub-problems. A common example is the problem of computing the nth Fibonacci number.

# 4. Recursion Algorithm
Recursion is a problem-solving technique in which the solution is dependent on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. A classic example of recursion is computing factorials.

# 5. Divide and Conquer
Divide and conquer is a general algorithmic strategy that involves breaking a problem down into smaller sub-problems and solving each sub-problem independently. An example of divide-and-conquer algorithm is the problem of finding the closest pair of points in a set of points in a 2-dimensional space.
